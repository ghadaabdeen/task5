        <center><h1 class="headingclass">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1></center>
        <center><p style="font-size: 120%;">The field of AI refers to developing computer systems that use big sets of data to perform “intelligent” tasks: think visual perception, understanding natural language, reasoning and decision making. Machine learning is one way of building such systems based on providing the computer with examples of what it should do, and let it figure out (learn) how to do it.
            AI entered the scene of computer science in the early 1950s when computers started learning checkers strategies and speaking English.
            Since then the field has made remarkable progress. With faster and more powerful computers, access to larger amounts of data and algorithm improvements, AI systems have taken off In diseases like cancer, early and quick diagnosis is the most important step towards a positive outcome for patients.
            One common diagnostic method is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specialised medical doctors detect cancer using MRI, however, there is a lack of this expertise in Australia – particularly in most remote areas of the country. This can delay the diagnosis of patients for whom time is crucial In the effort to enhance the Australian healthcare system and patient outcomes, researchers are looking for methods to predict mortality, and reduce readmission and length of stay of patients in hospitals.
            This involves handling huge amount of data such as patients symptoms, treatments, past history, age, etc., collected from hospitals and medical practices No matter of what science path we take, artificial intelligence is “an amazing new tool to have in our toolkit. It’s going to allow us to do things like process huge amounts of data quickly and get the answers to our research questions much faster,” says Amanda.
            “Machine learning will provide tools to help rapidly accelerate new discoveries across many areas of research,” says Elliot, “Because we can scale computation power much faster than human brain power, this allows discoveries to happen at an increasing pace AI refers to computational tools that are able to substitute for human.</p></center>
